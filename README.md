## What is this?
This repository holds some little helpers to make your life with your Banana Pi
easier. I might add more stuff to it in the future, and I also welcome
contributions from "fellow bananas" â€“ credits will be given, of course.


## What tools are contained?
Just check the sub-directories, where each "helper" should be provided with its
own `README` file. For now, we have:

* **userLED:** allows you to easily control the BananaPi's user LED


## License
I will keep these little things open source for all to use. Currently I chose
to put it under GPLv2.


## How to contribute?
### If you're familiar with Git and Github
The usual way: Clone this repo, add your contribution, send a pull request.

### If you're not familiar with Git/Github
Multiple choices here:

* make yourself familiar with both. It's worth it :)
* make yourself at least a Github account, then open a new "issue" and attach your contribution
* send me your contribution by mail
